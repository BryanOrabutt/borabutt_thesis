The TVC.csv file generated by the PSD channel testbench should be placed 
into the "data" subdirectory. Two lines will then be added to the start
of the file.

(1) Design variable information
(2) A timestamp

This means the actual data will start on the fourth line since
there is already a header line in the TVC.csv file.

The modified file will be saved as TVC_timestamp.dat into the
"data" sub-directory.

The linearity plots will be saved into the "pdf" subdirectory.

The "dvars" file contains design variable values for each of the simulation
runs the user desires.  The ; is the comment character.

The dvars file contents are combined with the ocean template to form the ocean
script.
